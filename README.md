# it's tuesday INIT
Yea it's a stupid title. 

## What it does
Meant to be used with Python's class __init__ method. Run command on __init__ line
and it will automatically assign the arguments to instance variables.

## Why it does
Decided to learn how to write lua plugins and felt like this would be a neat 
little exercise and something I would actually use. Also would be good to learn
how to leverage more of GitHub's features.
